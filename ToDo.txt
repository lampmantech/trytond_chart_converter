To Do List
==========

1) Pull out the dependencies on account_chart_netherlands.xml
from the converter, so that the converter is generic.

In some cases, the converter can read the information it needs
from reading the Oerp chart, but I'll move this information
to a config file - for each chart to convert there will be
a config file, as I think that there's more Oerp dependencies
to be pulled out, and this in a generic problem for all CoAs.
We provide a default based on the language (en.cfg nl.cfg) -
that way we can provide some examples and hopefully standardize
the chart ids within a language.

2) Turn the quick and dirty locale strings into po files.

3) Pull out the embedded tax rules in:
   build_tax_rule_template
   build_tax_rule_line_template
They may be specific dependencies on account_chart_netherlands.xml
or they may be generic to all netherlands charts (see below).

I'll check with Paul, but I think they should have been in the
Oerp xml chart, and just converted by the converter. Or if they are
Tryton specific per country, then the information should be 
in a config file, or a separate xml file that gets merged in.

3) I think there is a generic problem in both Tryton and Oerp:
they include the chart of taxes in the chart of accounts modules.
In fact, although there are an infinite number of ways to do
CoAs, depending on the business, there's really only one way
per country of doing the chart of taxes. Moreover, the CoAs
often change with time in a company, whereas the CoTs change
rarely, and do so for every chart in the country when they do.
Obviously there is information the CoTs need from the CoAs,
but this could also be a simple config file.
