commit 0456fb03fe3059482fa94af57e896e85eee9370e

    Factored out the tryton xml that was being created by the converter.
    There are 3 snippets, all tax related. The are now controlled
    by the config file.
    
    account.tax.group.xml will probably be the same for all charts
    (when translated).
    account.tax.rule.template_en.xml will probably be the same for
    all charts in a country, although the ones included are both "wrong"
    as they should have sale/purchase cross local/EU/non-EU;
    6 lines not 4.
    account.tax.rule.line.template.xml I don't understand, and
    need help on to do a UK version.
