commit fa3fe13fa891d242ae84e22d221e04bf72015bbe

    Made some progress on the tax handling, and now the split texfile
    refers to the right values in  the CoAs using model/search.
    
    Still not handling account.tax.rule.line.template yet,
    as they are undocumented in Tryton.

commit c1a146cda947f69fcaa1b833199c4f8536d1b894

    Added a --taxfile option to split the CoTs from the CoAds.
    If you don't provide an --outfile option, then output is to stdout.
    If you provide an --outfile option, but don't provide a --taxfile
    option, then all output is to the outfile.  If you provide an --outfile
    option and a --taxfile option, then the account info is output is to the
    outfile, and the chart of taxes is output to the taxfile.
    
    Splitting the two is generally a good idea, because the account chart
    varies with the type of the company's business, but the tax chart is
    the same for all companies within a country, state or province.

    Factored out the tryton xml that was being created by the converter.
    There are 3 snippets, all tax related. The are now controlled
    by the config file.
    
    account.tax.group.xml will probably be the same for all charts
    (when translated).
    account.tax.rule.template_en.xml will probably be the same for
    all charts in a country, although the ones included are both "wrong"
    as they should have sale/purchase cross local/EU/non-EU;
    6 lines not 4.
    account.tax.rule.line.template.xml I don't understand, and
    need help on to do a UK version.
